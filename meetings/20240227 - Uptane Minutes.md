## Principal decisions and topics from the Feb. 27, 2024 Uptane Standards committee meeting

* We will begin publishing agendas and minutes publicly in the uptane community repository at https://github.com/uptane/community/
* There will be an Uptane workshop after escar US, on June 7th 2024
  * The location and time is already set: Friday June 7th, 10AM - 3:30PM EDT, at Renesas headquarters (34705 W 12 Mile Rd #300, Farmington Hills, MI 48331)
  * We need to start programming topics; Phil Lapczyniski will organize a separate call for planning the content and invitees
  * For the first time, we will publish the invite publicly
  * Expanding Uptane beyond the automotive industry should be a main theme, expanding on last year's discussions about using Uptane in robotics
  * Cameron Mott may have some topics to present as well
* Jon Oster will create a new meeting series in the slot previously used for the website project update/sync. This new series will be an opportunity for anyone with questions about Uptane to ask more experienced members of the community, but for now is especially focused on potential GSoC contributors.
* Deployment considerations will move permanently to the uptane.github.io repository, rather than keeping them in a separate repo.
* Cameron Mott shared the news that SWRI will begin offering Uptane conformance/compliance certification and testing; further details to come at a later date

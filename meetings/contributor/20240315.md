# Topics
## Proposal 1: Integrating aktualizr with popular embedded software updater
* It appears that swupdate allows for hashes within the sw-description
  * https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/signed_images.html?highlight=hash#example-for-sw-description-with-signed-image
* Q: What is base case for the example, how many partitions?
* A: At least 4. 1 boot partition, 2 for the A/B rootfs,
* Likely solution is to encode the sw-description information within the custom metadata in Uptane.
## Proposal 2: Creating an open-source web UI for OTA Community Edition
* There is a demo at https://uptanedemo.org
* The GSoC contributor will be expected to propose the design changes for the UI
